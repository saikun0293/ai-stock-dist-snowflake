# Problem & Goal

Hospitals, public distribution systems, and NGOs struggle to keep medicines, food, and other essentials available in the right place at the right time. Data on sales/usage, inventory, and purchase orders often lives in separate systems, so teams spot stock issues only when shelves are already empty or over-full.

Using a simple daily stock dataset (for example: location, item, opening_stock, received, issued, closing_stock, lead_time_days), build a single view of stock health that:

- Shows a heatmap by location and item
- Warns early about items likely to run out within a few days
- Suggests sensible reorder quantities or priority lists, with an easy export that procurement or field teams can act on

This problem statement we are solving in this project is AI for Good because it helps reduce waste and avoid stock-outs of critical supplies.

## Technology Stack: Snowflake

Using Worksheets/SQL, Dynamic Tables (auto-refresh calculations), Streams & Tasks (scheduling), Streamlit (dashboard); optional Snowpark (basic demand estimate); optional Unistore for action logs.

## Data Set Overview

The dashboard is powered by a central InventoryData sheet that captures the complete lifecycle and status of every Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) in our fulfillment centers.

### Core Product & Location Identifiers

- **SKU_ID / SKU_Name**: Unique identifiers for each product
- **Warehouse_ID**: The fulfillment center where the stock is located
- **Category**: The product category (e.g., Fresh Produce, Dairy, Frozen Goods)
- **Supplier_Name**: The vendor who supplies the product
- **ABC_Class**: The inventory categorization (A, B, C) based on value and sales velocity, crucial for prioritization

### Stock Quantity & Status

- **Quantity_On_Hand (QOH)**: The total physical quantity of an item in the warehouse
- **Quantity_Reserved**: Stock allocated to processed but not-yet-shipped customer orders
- **Quantity_Committed**: Stock allocated for promotions, transfers, or other internal uses
- **Received_Date**: The date stock was last received into the warehouse
- **Expiry_Date**: The expiration date of the batch, a critical field for perishable goods

### Planning & Velocity Metrics

- **Avg_Daily_Sales**: The average number of units sold per day, used for demand forecasting
- **Reorder_Point**: The stock level at which a new purchase order should be triggered
- **Safety_Stock**: The buffer stock level maintained to mitigate stockouts from unexpected demand or supplier delays
- **Lead_Time_Days**: The average time in days from placing a purchase order to receiving the goods

### Financial & Quality Metrics

- **Total_Inventory_Value_USD**: The total financial value of the on-hand stock for an SKU
- **Stock_Age_Days**: The number of days the current stock has been held
- **Damaged_Qty / Returns_Qty**: The quantity of units recorded as damaged or returned
- **Supplier_OnTime_Pct**: The percentage of time a supplier delivers within the agreed window
- **Demand_Forecast_Accuracy_Pct**: The accuracy percentage of our sales forecast versus actual sales
- **Audit_Variance_Pct**: The percentage variance found during physical cycle counts versus system records

## Guidelines

- Do not create too many documentation files. Ask for permission before adding documentation files
- Edit existing files instead of creating new ones with `_new` suffix
